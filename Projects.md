<h2>Pyrat</h2>

This project was part of computer sciences class. It was a first year project, made to deepen python knowledge.
The purpose of the project was to optimize the route of a rat moving on a 
maze to catch pieces of cheese randomly placed on a fixed-size maze.
I implemented a python algorithm using usual maze resolution algorithm models. 
Then i took part into a competition to select the fastest algorithm.
Several parts were tackled :
* Mathematical maze resolution
* Understanding of usual algorithms (Backtracking, Dijkstra...) and implementation applied to the scenario
* Glimpse of code optimisation techniques

One of my mistake was not to explore other algorithms possibilities. I chose to implement one of the algorithms seen in class 
instead of being more curious. Then i pushed the limits of this algorithm not regarding other methods. 
That's the main reason why i didn't win the competition.


<h2>DEC Project</h2>

It was made on my first year in IMT. I was part of a multicultural group working together to create a robot
using an Arduino card. The purpose was to win a race against other students.
Each of us split on different tasks. I took part in the design creation for the robot. 
After balancing between aesthetic and performance
i designed the blueprint on Cura, and printed in 3d the shell of our vehicle.

<h2>DEV Project</h2>

The topic was a suggestion from a teacher for our group. He's teaching Big Data in IMT to 3rd year students. He was using a Raspberry PI 
server in class and wanted us to reorganise the pi's in order to be easily carried and 
then install Docker on each cards. What we did :
* Design a box to carry the server from class to class to plug one ethernet and deliver power supply from one plug
* Install Debian on the PI's
* List IP adresses using Putty
* Attempt to install Docker
